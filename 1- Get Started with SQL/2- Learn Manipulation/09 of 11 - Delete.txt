MANIPULATION
Delete
The DELETE FROM statement deletes one or more rows from a table. You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records. The statement below deletes all records in the celeb table with no twitter_handle:

DELETE FROM celebs 
WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;
DELETE FROM is a clause that lets you delete rows from a table.
celebs is the name of the table we want to delete rows from.
WHERE is a clause that lets you select which rows you want to delete. Here we want to delete all of the rows where the twitter_handle column IS NULL.
IS NULL is a condition in SQL that returns true when the value is NULL and false otherwise.
Instructions
1.
Delete all of the rows that have a NULL value in the twitter handle column. In the code editor, type the following:

DELETE FROM celebs 
WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM celebs; 
How many rows exist in the celebs table now?
