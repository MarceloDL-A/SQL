MANIPULATION
Update
The UPDATE statement edits a row in a table. You can use the UPDATE statement when you want to change existing records. The statement below updates the record with an id value of 4 to have the twitter_handle @taylorswift13.

UPDATE celebs 
SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13' 
WHERE id = 4; 
1. UPDATE is a clause that edits a row in the table.
2. celebs is the name of the table.
3. SET is a clause that indicates the column to edit.

twitter_handle is the name of the column that is going to be updated
@taylorswift13 is the new value that is going to be inserted into the twitter_handle column.
4. WHERE is a clause that indicates which row(s) to update with the new column value. Here the row with a 4 in the id column is the row that will have the twitter_handle updated to @taylorswift13.

Instructions
1.
Update the table to include Taylor Swift’s twitter handle. In the code editor, type:

UPDATE celebs 
SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13' 
WHERE id = 4; 

SELECT * FROM celebs;
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
Double-check your statement character by character:

Did you include the underscore in twitter_handle?
Did you include the @ in Taylor’s twitter_handle?
Notice the single quotes around @taylorswift13. This is because text strings require quotes around them, while numbers don’t.
